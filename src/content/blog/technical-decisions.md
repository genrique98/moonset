I could start a blog with a single HTML file and a web domain, but I won't do that because I don't want to. I wont't use Nextjs either because it seems unnecessary.

> Astro/Reactjs/TailwindCSS site deployed on Cloudflare's CDN

<br/>
Bought the domain for $5, started the Astro website, wrote some mediocre blogposts, and deployed it on Cloudflare.
<br/>
First issue was that I didn't specify the Node version in a .nvmrc file `(16.13.0)`
The second issue was the I used pnpm as my package manager and Cloudflare does not support it. So I'm installing it globally everytime I deploy it. `npm -g install pnpm && pnpm run build`
<br/>
There's probably no need to be this specific when it comes to issues so I won't do it anymore.
