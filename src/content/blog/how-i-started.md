I'm trying to start a blog about starting stuff. I'm starting this completely out of a hunch, but I plan on writing the blog posts, coding the website, and learning and improving the website along the way. I obviously don't know where to start, so I asked ChatGPT.
It seems like I need to define my purpose, make a plan to fulfill it, make a website, and start writing. It also said: 
> Remember, starting something new is always challenging, but the most important thing is to take that first step. With persistence and dedication, you can build a successful blog and inspire others to start their own journeys.

<br/>
Nothing I haven't heard before, but I need to start somewhere.
1. Purpose of the blog: To start and iterate quickly
2. Plan: I will post whenever (might change later); I will write short articles about starting this blog;
3. Website: I will use Figma to design a simple UI. 
4. Platform: I believe I will use Nextjs + Tailwind, Cloudflare CDN + functions + D1 since I want to make a CMS later on.
<br/><br/>
Not sure that this will inspire others like ChatGPT says, but I do hope it inspires me to stay consistent. Also, for context, Iâ€™m inevitably approaching this as someone who suffers from anxiety and overthinks every step, but I want to start a tiny project that somehow shows me to overcome the process of starting something extremely simple and remaining consistent instead of thinking of every tiny detail ahead of time. I will proceed to design the website.
<br/><br/>
This is a blog about starting. Not sure what it will turn into. This is the first blogpost, so it would make sense to include everything I have done so far.
