I'm trying to start a blog about the concept of starting. I plan on writing the blog posts, coding the website, and reading about ways to improve the website. I don't know where to start, which is ironic given that the blog is literally about starting. How should I start?

Starting something new can be overwhelming, even if it's something as simple as starting a blog. Here are a few steps you can take to help you get started:
1. Define your purpose: Start by defining the purpose of your blog. What do you hope to achieve with it? Who is your target audience? What kind of topics do you want to cover? Having a clear idea of what you want to accomplish can help guide your efforts and keep you focused.
2. Make a plan: Once you've defined your purpose, create a plan for how you'll achieve your goals. This can include things like how often you'll post, what kind of content you'll create, and how you'll promote your blog.
3. Choose a platform: There are many blogging platforms available, such as WordPress and Blogger. Research your options and choose the one that best fits your needs.
4. Create your website: If you plan on coding your website yourself, start by creating a wireframe or a design mockup to help guide your development. If you're not comfortable with coding, consider using a website builder that can help you create a professional-looking site without any coding knowledge.
5. Start writing: With your website up and running, it's time to start creating content. Begin with a few blog posts that reflect your interests and expertise, and be sure to promote your posts on social media and other channels to help build your audience.
Remember, starting something new is always challenging, but the most important thing is to take that first step. With persistence and dedication, you can build a successful blog and inspire others to start their own journeys.


Purpose of the blog: i hope to start

Plan: I will post whenever (might change later); I will write short articles about starting this blog; I’m not sure that I will promote this blog

Website: I will use Figma to design a simple website. Should be extremely minimal.

Platform: I believe I will use Nextjs + Tailwind, Cloudflare CDN + functions + + D1. Later on, I want create a UI to for a minimal CMS to submit blogposts.


This is a blog about starting. Not sure what it will turn into. This is the first blogpost, so it would make sense to include everything I have done so far.

Not sure that this will inspire others, like ChatGPT says, but I do hope it inspires me to stay consistent. Also, for context, I’m kind of approaching this as someone who is interested in jungian archetypes and the hero’s journey and Hermeticism, but also suffers from social anxiety and overthinks everything. Maybe I’ve been watching and playing StarWars and Hogwarts Legacy too much, but I do think that it I want to start a tiny project that somehow shows me to overcome the process of starting something simple and remaining consistent. This is something that is supposed to be extremely simple, especially because this is my first blog… So will proceed to design the website.
