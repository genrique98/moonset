I keep thinking to myself that I need to write. It’s certainly the weirdest cliche. But here I am.

I asked ChatGPT: I started a blog about ‘starting’. How could I treat my blog as metaphorical Philosopher's Stone to guide me in a journey of transmutation of the self?
<br/>

> Treating your blog as a metaphorical Philosopher's Stone can be an interesting way to guide your journey of self-transmutation. Here are a few suggestions on how to approach this:
> 1. Approach your writing as a form of alchemical transformation: Just as alchemists sought to transform base metals into gold, you can approach your writing as a way to transform the raw materials of your thoughts and experiences into something valuable and insightful. As you write, reflect on how your ideas are evolving and changing over time, and think about how you can distill the most valuable insights from your experiences.
> 2. Use your blog to explore new ideas and perspectives: The Philosopher's Stone was often associated with the idea of knowledge and wisdom, so use your blog as a tool for exploration and discovery. Write about new topics and ideas that you want to learn more about, and use your writing as a way to deepen your understanding of the world around you.
> 3. Practice self-reflection through your writing: Hermeticism emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and introspection as a path to spiritual growth. Use your blog as a tool for self-reflection, writing about your personal journey and the lessons you are learning along the way. This can help you gain deeper insights into your own motivations, desires, and fears, and can ultimately help you to better understand and transform yourself.
> 4. Engage with your readers as part of the alchemical process: In the alchemical tradition, the process of transformation often involved working with others and sharing knowledge and insights. Use your blog to engage with your readers and create a community of like-minded individuals who are also interested in self-transformation. This can help you to refine your ideas, gain new perspectives, and deepen your understanding of the alchemical process.

Gibberish. Anyway, just to be clear, I don’t think I can have realistic hopes for the success of this blog because I haven't and won't set any KPIs. I want to follow my intuition and write, code, and learn as I please. I think that’s what I’m doing right now by not having any process in place, but I can already feel many ideas bubble up and the need to write them down, mostly because I know that ideas are notoriously hard to capture as clearly as I dream them, which is still somewhat blurry, but I will do one thing at a time.

I always feel like I’m missing something. It’s like a brain itch won’t go away until I start a project, but I never start because I  overwhelm myself, like the chicken-and-the-egg thing. It's so easy to numb my brain with one or five Youtube videos because there are so many hypothetical reasons not to write, like lacking credibility, being boring, finding out that I am a bad writer, eventually losing interest in what I thought I wanted, not having any readers, wasting my time, being too vulnerable, not being vulnerable enough. Usually, after starting anything, I begin to think of some other idea worth pursuing, until I gracefully switch my attention and daydream pointlessly of yet another idea. My hope is that this is, at the very least, an art project I can look back to and not cringe too much.

I will write about some or all of these fears because they are just ideas and habits that will come up as I’m building and writing for this site.
