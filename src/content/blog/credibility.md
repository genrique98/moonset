> Besides being read, what did writers ever achieve?

I believe that having readers is the most a writer can aspire to. Being correct or persuasive are ideal goals, but by far, most people who intend to say anything through any medium can only dream of having an audience large enough to match their initial expectations and have enough reasons to continue. In other words, nobody likes talking to a wall.
