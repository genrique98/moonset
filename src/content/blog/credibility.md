> Besides being read, what did writers ever achieve?

I believe that having readers is the most the average writer can aspire to. Being "correct" or persuasive are ideal goals, but by far, most people who intend to say anything through any medium can only dream of having an audience large enough to match their initial expectations and have enough reasons to continue. In other words, nobody likes talking to a wall, and nobody pays attention to someone talking to a wall anyway. 

I hate the concept of building an audience, but how can the average writer gain any subtanstial following? By average writer I obviously mean me, or other people who have nothing to say online other than their inital attempts at finding their voice. The obvious thing here is that no writer with no porfolio deserves any readers, but even after a considerable amount of decent articles/essays/etc, why would anyone care? why would your one hypothetical reader share your writing? I must point out that this is largely me talking to myself (just like any other post here) in an attempt to feel permission to continue developing this and future blogs.
