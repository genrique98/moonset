> Besides being read, what did writers ever achieve?

I believe that having readers is the most the average writer can aspire to. Being "correct" or persuasive are ideal goals, but by far, most people who intend to say anything through any medium can only dream of having an audience large enough to match their initial expectations and have enough reasons to continue. In other words, nobody likes talking to a wall, and nobody pays attention to someone talking to a wall anyway. 

I hate the concept of building an audience, but how can the average writer gain any subtanstial following? By average writer I obviously mean me, or other people who have nothing to say online other than their inital attempts at finding their voice. The obvious thing here is that no writer with no porfolio deserves any readers, but even after a considerable amount of decent articles/essays/etc, why would anyone care? why would your one hypothetical reader share your writing? I must point out that this is largely me talking to myself (just like any other post here) in an attempt to feel permission to continue developing this and future blogs. In short, I believe that when it comes to harmless personal articles, readers care about relatability, usefulness, and eloquence, which is what I'm aiming for right now, not that anyone is casually reading this post and seeing if it checks all their personal boxes. 

This is mostly tangential to the debate on Speech vs Reach on Twitter and other social media platforms: Anyone can say almost anything online because freedom of speech is constitutionally protected, but being able to reach a large audience is not. 

In this case, I'm saying you can create whatever type writing/content you want, but, obviously, nobody is entitled to followers.
But here is where I get confused

From my perspective, technical/specialized content should be written by someone who has expertise in such field to be worthy of a following, but that is certainly not the case online. Anyone writes about anything and still gets a following. So in a way this just concerns people who are tying to create quality content, where quality is based on their own subjective experience and the type of people who cosign said writing. Meaning, how could I create content that is widely respected by both the general public and experts?
The answer is by carefully choosing sources in the research, writing eloquently and coherently, and developing a quality body of work over time. 
I believe this type of relevance should be achievable by anyone who wants create quality work
How do you create a publishing house or self publish successfully without relying on a established network?


Credibility = Good reputation

Paper / Network credibility 

The best thing about graduating from stanford is being able to say you graduated from standord
Ivy league universites have an extense network. Highly respected people in any field are often part of these networks. Obviously the institutions do create quality work and individuals, and then those individuals reinforce the network. But justing having those words on a resume can definitely give you extra points based on network credibility alone. The same happens with job titles, for example "Senior Software engineer at Microsoft". Again, institutions that have built their reputations over decades. 

I guess I'm interested in creating such an organization (LOL)
