Start Extremely Small
Prioritize features
Technical debt
rapid protoyping 
testing feasability and interest

thought 
on rapid prototyping. dont be afraid of using libraries such as ‘headless ui (tailwind)’ for extreme rapid prototyping. best for developing products quickly and testing against customer demand; it can always be changed later. no need to spend countless hours on customs ui elements / functions / etc if there is no evidence that the product actually works. good to test with nocode tools for first couple of costumers, but switch them out for in-house code for scale to minimize costs.
