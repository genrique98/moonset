I NEED TO WRITE. I keep telling myself that I need to write. It’s certainly the weirdest cliche. But here I am.

I asked ChatGPT: I started a blog about ‘starting’. How could I treat the blog as metaphorical Philosopher's Stone guiding me in a journey of transmutation of the self?

Treating your blog as a metaphorical Philosopher's Stone can be an interesting way to guide your journey of self-transmutation. Here are a few suggestions on how to approach this:
1. Approach your writing as a form of alchemical transformation: Just as alchemists sought to transform base metals into gold, you can approach your writing as a way to transform the raw materials of your thoughts and experiences into something valuable and insightful. As you write, reflect on how your ideas are evolving and changing over time, and think about how you can distill the most valuable insights from your experiences.
2. Use your blog to explore new ideas and perspectives: The Philosopher's Stone was often associated with the idea of knowledge and wisdom, so use your blog as a tool for exploration and discovery. Write about new topics and ideas that you want to learn more about, and use your writing as a way to deepen your understanding of the world around you.
3. Practice self-reflection through your writing: Hermeticism emphasizes the importance of self-reflection and introspection as a path to spiritual growth. Use your blog as a tool for self-reflection, writing about your personal journey and the lessons you are learning along the way. This can help you gain deeper insights into your own motivations, desires, and fears, and can ultimately help you to better understand and transform yourself.
4. Engage with your readers as part of the alchemical process: In the alchemical tradition, the process of transformation often involved working with others and sharing knowledge and insights. Use your blog to engage with your readers and create a community of like-minded individuals who are also interested in self-transformation. This can help you to refine your ideas, gain new perspectives, and deepen your understanding of the alchemical process.


I mean it truly is a compass for the mind! I’ve been thinking about this for days! days! I just cannot arrive at that conclusion as fast. To be clear, I just want to actually start, I don’t think I can have realistic hopes for the success of this blog or theory. I want to follow my intuition. That’s what I’m doing right now. I think. As I am building this, I can already feel many ideas bubble up and the need to write them down. Mostly because I know that ideas are notoriously hard to capture as clearly as I dream them, which is still somewhat blurry, but I will focus on one thing at a time. From now on, I will probably stop explaining my need to write. I just needed to explain myself.

It’s worrisome how much I overthink. I always feel like I’m missing something. It’s like a brain itch won’t go away until I start, like the chicken and the egg. There are so many reasons that stop me, like the right words, I worry about not being credible, I worry about being boring, I worry that the task I have given myself requires too much work considering my level of interest, I worry that this blog won’t have a single reader, I’m terrified of finding out that I am a bad writer, I’m terrified of not committing to this project either. Usually, I begin to think of some other idea I could be pursuing, until gracefully switch my absolute attention. I daydream pointlessly. My hope is that this is, at the very least, an art project.

I will write about some or all of these fears because they are ideas and bad habits that I will have to fight as I’m building and writing for this project. I will also start documenting my technical progress. In the future I will find a way for the hypothetical readers to filter out non-technical or technical posts. 

I should start by saying that I don’t fear starting things in general, but I do have difficulty starting projects that involve coding or writing because I do care about how good I am at them. I care considerably more about writing than I do about coding.
